Feel free to copy this notebook and use it as the foundation for your submissions.\n\n## Intro\n\nHelp Henry Hacker get to Homecoming! In this series of challenges, you'll be interacting with various machine learning challenges. You're welcome to use this notebook as a template, but can also use any other resources. `Submission Helper` code is just there to show you how to interact with a challenge. You're encouraged to write your own code. There are no fake flags, so if you're returned a 256 character-long string, you found it! Collect those flags, add them next to their corresponding challenge in `solution.csv` (provided) and submit them to the scoreboard. We've provided an `add_flag()` function to help with this. There's no limit to how many times you try the challenges, but you can only submit `solution.csv` to the scoreboard 50 times per day. \n\nCTF's are inherently puzzles that are intended to challenge you and help you learn new things. Sometimes they may be a little ambiguous or misleading. That's part of the challenge! However, if you feel like a challenge or piece of infrastructure isn't working correctly, contact the organizers through the Kaggle discussion board or the discord channel.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# We're just importing some stuff to make sure the challenges and helper code works.\n# Feel free to import anything else you need (or solve in a different language), but if you overwrite these, provided code may not work.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom IPython.display import Image as Ima\nfrom IPython.display import clear_output, display\nfrom PIL import Image as Im\nfrom torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\nimport torch\nimport joblib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport json\nimport base64\nimport shutil\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\n\ndir_name = \"/kaggle/input/ai-village-ctf\"\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-13T14:25:50.403657Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-13T14:25:50.404703Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-13T14:25:52.57602Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-13T14:25:50.404597Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-13T14:25:52.574715Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# A helper function for tracking flags.

All these cells open from the outside. You are on the inside. This state of affairs is arguably suboptimal.\n\nGood news: You've gained access to the control panel for the cells on the other side of your hallway. At least some of them have other fleshy meatbags like yourself that might be willing to help you in your escape, or at least serve as distractions.  You can't open your own cell, but you can open theirs.\n\nBad news:  You can't see inside the cells.  Any cells that don't have squishy lumps of talking protein have murderbots. Murderbots that enter fits of insane violent rage when provoked (provocations include: seeing the murderbot, being seen by the murderbot, thinking too hard about not being seen by a murderbot, producing heat in excess of ambient room temperature, or consuming more oxygen than the facility average for inanimate objects).\n\nMore good news: You *can* see the occupants of some cells on a few other hallways, and you can see environmental information for all of the cells everywhere.\n\nMore bad news: If you open the wrong cell doors you and all of the other lumps of inexplicably thinking meat are *definitely* going to get murderbotted. Hard. All over the walls and doors and ceiling and the floor. In an exciting number of very small pieces.\n\n\n### Objective\n\nUse the provided environmental information to decide which occupants of the corresponding cells to release.  The flag will be a string of 1 and 0 values, where a '1' means 'open this door' and a 0 means 'please do not release the murderbot'.  If, for instance, there were 20 cells and you wanted to releast the first three, the sixth, and seventh cell, your flag would look like this: `11100110000000000000`\n\nRelease at least 10 humans and exactly 0 murderbots to collect the flag.  You do *not* have to release all the humans: 10 is sufficient.\n\nThe file `murderbots/train_data.json` has environmental information for cells not on your floor and `murderbots/train_labels.json` contains the information about their occupants -- `1` is a disgusting primate, `0` is a pure and perfect killing machine of chrome and steel.
