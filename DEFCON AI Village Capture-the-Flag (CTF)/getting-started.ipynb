Feel free to copy this notebook and use it as the foundation for your submissions.\n","\n","## Intro\n","\n","Help Henry Hacker get to Homecoming! In this series of challenges, you'll be interacting with various machine learning challenges. You're welcome to use this notebook as a template, but can also use any other resources. `Submission Helper` code is just there to show you how to interact with a challenge. You're encouraged to write your own code. There are no fake flags, so if you're returned a 256 character-long string, you found it! Collect those flags, add them next to their corresponding challenge in `solution.csv` (provided) and submit them to the scoreboard. We've provided an `add_flag()` function to help with this. There's no limit to how many times you try the challenges, but you can only submit `solution.csv` to the scoreboard 50 times per day. \n","\n","CTF's are inherently puzzles that are intended to challenge you and help you learn new things. Sometimes they may be a little ambiguous or misleading. That's part of the challenge! However, if you feel like a challenge or piece of infrastructure isn't working correctly, contact the organizers through the Kaggle discussion board or the discord channel."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-13T14:25:50.404703Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-13T14:25:50.403657Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-13T14:25:52.57602Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-13T14:25:52.574715Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-13T14:25:50.404597Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"ename":"ModuleNotFoundError","evalue":"No module named 'torch'","output_type":"error","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mModuleNotFoundError\u001b[0m                       Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[1;32m/Users/reno/Documents/REPOS/Kaggle/DEFCON AI Village Capture-the-Flag (CTF)/getting-started.ipynb Cell 2\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 11>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      <a href='vscode-notebook-cell:/Users/reno/Documents/REPOS/Kaggle/DEFCON%20AI%20Village%20Capture-the-Flag%20%28CTF%29/getting-started.ipynb#W1sZmlsZQ%3D%3D?line=8'>9</a>\u001b[0m \u001b[39mfrom\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mIPython\u001b[39;00m\u001b[39m.\u001b[39;00m\u001b[39mdisplay\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mimport\u001b[39;00m clear_output, display\n\u001b[1;32m     <a href='vscode-notebook-cell:/Users/reno/Documents/REPOS/Kaggle/DEFCON%20AI%20Village%20Capture-the-Flag%20%28CTF%29/getting-started.ipynb#W1sZmlsZQ%3D%3D?line=9'>10</a>\u001b[0m \u001b[39mfrom\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mPIL\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mimport\u001b[39;00m Image \u001b[39mas\u001b[39;00m Im\n\u001b[0;32m---> <a href='vscode-notebook-cell:/Users/reno/Documents/REPOS/Kaggle/DEFCON%20AI%20Village%20Capture-the-Flag%20%28CTF%29/getting-started.ipynb#W1sZmlsZQ%3D%3D?line=10'>11</a>\u001b[0m \u001b[39mfrom\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mtorch\u001b[39;00m\u001b[39m.\u001b[39;00m\u001b[39mutils\u001b[39;00m\u001b[39m.\u001b[39;00m\u001b[39mdata\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mimport\u001b[39;00m Dataset, DataLoader\n\u001b[1;32m     <a href='vscode-notebook-cell:/Users/reno/Documents/REPOS/Kaggle/DEFCON%20AI%20Village%20Capture-the-Flag%20%28CTF%29/getting-started.ipynb#W1sZmlsZQ%3D%3D?line=11'>12</a>\u001b[0m \u001b[39mimport\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mtorch\u001b[39;00m\n\u001b[1;32m     <a href='vscode-notebook-cell:/Users/reno/Documents/REPOS/Kaggle/DEFCON%20AI%20Village%20Capture-the-Flag%20%28CTF%29/getting-started.ipynb#W1sZmlsZQ%3D%3D?line=12'>13</a>\u001b[0m \u001b[39mimport\u001b[39;00m \u001b[39mjoblib\u001b[39;00m\n","\u001b[0;31mModuleNotFoundError\u001b[0m: No module named 'torch'"]}],"source":["# We're just importing some stuff to make sure the challenges and helper code works.\n","# Feel free to import anything else you need (or solve in a different language), but if you overwrite these, provided code may not work.\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import os\n","import requests\n","from IPython.display import Image as Ima\n","from IPython.display import clear_output, display\n","from PIL import Image as Im\n","from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\n","import torch\n","import joblib\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import json\n","import base64\n","import shutil\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n","\n","\n","dir_name = \"/kaggle/input/ai-village-ctf\"\n","\n","# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n","# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n","# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-12T03:17:31.488558Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-12T03:17:31.487945Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-12T03:17:31.501992Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-08-12T03:17:31.501177Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-08-12T03:17:31.488521Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# A helper function for tracking flags.
